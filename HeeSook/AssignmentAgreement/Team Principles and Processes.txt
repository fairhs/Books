        Effective online channel for communication should be utilized.
        Everyone must show individual commitment to each task in assignment 1 and 2.
        Effective collaborative work should be conducted to maximize understanding all part of the data mining in this group work without unnecessary blaming.
 
Non-Compliance
        In the group work, any inappropriate manner cannot be ignored.
